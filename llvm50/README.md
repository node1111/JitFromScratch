# JitFromScratch
Collection of examples from my talks in the [LLVM Social Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/LLVM-Social-Berlin/) and [C++ User Group Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/berlincplusplus/) that showcase techniques for implementing various aspects of a JIT compiler built with the LLVM 5.0 ORC libraries. The repository follows a *perfect history* policy to foster traceability and understanding.

**This is the LLVM 4.0 compatible version of the examples. Please find latest updates [here](https://github.com/weliveindetail/JitFromScratch).**

## Build

All examples are tested on Linux Mint 18, Mac OS X 10.12 and Windows 10. Please find detailed instructions in [Building a JIT from scratch](https://weliveindetail.github.io/blog/post/2017/07/18/building-a-jit-from-scratch.html).

## Structure

The [jit-basics](https://github.com/weliveindetail/JitFromScratch/commits/jit-basics) establish a common code base for all further examples by demonstrating how to compile the code for a simple function at runtime:

```
template <size_t sizeOfArray>
int *integerDistances(const int (&x)[sizeOfArray], int *y) {
  int items = arrayElements(x);
  int *results = customIntAllocator(items);

  for (int i = 0; i < items; i++) {
    results[i] = abs(x[i] - y[i]);
  }

  return results;
}
```
